##### Comment
The above is a visualization of the 2018 WCA Competitor Network.  Connections between competitors are defined as having competed in the same competition in 2018.  The colours are defined by continent the competitor is from.

##### Process
I included a jupyter notebook in this repo which outlines my process for compiling and shaping the data for analysis: ![wca_download_and_db_setup.ipynb](wca_download_and_db_setup.ipynb)

I created the chart using Gephi (on Docker, https://hub.docker.com/r/dit4c/dit4c-container-gephi).
